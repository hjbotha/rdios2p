# Rdio Now Playing

http://rdios2p.herokuapp.com/

rdios2p is a means to enable offline stations, after a fashion.

It accepts a station URL, asks Rdio for a list of songs for that station, creates a playlist, and enables download on that playlist, so you can listen to it on your phone without incurring data charges.

# Credit Where Credit Is Due

I'm not a coder so I used jnewland's nifty Now Playing app (https://github.com/jnewland/rdio-nowplaying) as a base and adapted it. Thanks!
